# surway-polls
Surway+ Django app is a full-featured polling app. You do not have to register in this app to show the polls just choose a question and click on an option to vote. If you already voted you can not vote again. Only the owner of the app can add a poll, edit a poll, update a poll, delete a poll, add a choice, update a choice, delete a choice, and end a poll. The ended poll only shows the user the final result of the poll. Pagination will work even after applying the filter.

- 📝 Simple design: No mass of options, only the essentials. Works well on mobile of course.

- 📊 Response visualization and exporting

- 🔒 Data under your control! Unlike in Google Forms, Typeform, Doodle, and others, the survey info and responses are kept private on your instance.
