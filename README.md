# surway-polls
Surway+ django app is a full featured polling app. You do not have to register in this app to show the polls just choose a question and click on an option to vote. If you already voted you can not vote again. Only the owner of the app can add poll , edit poll, update poll, delete poll , add choice, update choice, delete choice and end a poll. Ended poll only shows user the final result of the poll. Pagination will work even after applying filter.

📝 Simple design: No mass of options, only the essentials. Works well on mobile of course.

📊 Response visualization and exporting

🔒 Data under your control! Unlike in Google Forms, Typeform, Doodle and others, the survey info and responses are kept private on your instance.
